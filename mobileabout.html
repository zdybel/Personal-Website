			<p> I am a full-stack web-developer located in the greater Philadelphia area.  I am a creative, detail oriented person and enjoy the variety of challenges that programming and design present.  Before finding my passion for web developement and design, I worked in many customer-service related industries, including interpreting for Spanish medical patients, working in the banking industry and other service-industry related jobs.  I see working as a privelage, and look forward to discussing any projects you have in mind.   Also, if one of my projects catch your eye, I would love to talk to you about those as well.  Feel free to contact me in whichever way is best for you.  Have a great day and thanks for visiting my site!</p>
